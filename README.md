# Football Media Engagement & AI Sentiment Analysis
**Student Portfolio - IB2AD0: Data Science & AI**

## Project Overview
This repository documents my journey through the Data Science & AI module, culminating in a deep-dive analysis of football social media engagement. Using data from **Sportbible, Goal, and Sporf**, I identify the structural and emotional drivers that dictate fan interaction.

## Technical Workflow (Hybrid Environment)
To handle the scale of this analysis, I utilized a professional-grade workflow:
* **Development:** 41 specialized Python scripts developed in **Visual Studio Code** for data orchestration and API management.
* **AI Modelling:** Leveraged **Hugging Face Transformers (RoBERTa)** for 28-way emotion classification and **GPT-4o-mini** for automated theme tagging.
* **Strategic Insights:** Data processed via Python was exported to **Excel** to create the final strategic blueprints and visualizations.

## Repository Structure
* `/01` to `/04`: Seminar exercises demonstrating technical competence in Python, ML, and NLP.
* `/05_Capstone_Football_Project`: 
    * `football_analysis_master.ipynb`: The main narrative combining code, logic, and the strategic blueprints.
    * `/scripts`: Archive of the 41 original production scripts used in VS Code.
    * `/visuals`: High-impact charts and heatmaps from the project blueprint.
