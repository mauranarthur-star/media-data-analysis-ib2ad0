We also don't want to use the training data as this can't measure overfitting (overfitting can only be measured on unseen data). We could do cross validation but this will be very expensive to do over many epochs (i.e. it will take ages). So instead we will split our data an extra time and create a `val` set. This will be used to measure performance over epochs, but also can be used to tune other hyperparameters.\n",
