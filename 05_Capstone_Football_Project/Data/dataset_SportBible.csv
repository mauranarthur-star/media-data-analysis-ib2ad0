Shay Patel was a Chelsea fan whose favourite player was Chilwell, with the two having an extra connection of having played for grassroots club Woburn Lions, near Milton Keynes ⚽️🔵

The 13-year-old sadly passed away from a glioblastoma brain tumour, and the England left-back is now a patron of the Shay Smiles charity, and he accompanied Shay’s parents to the Brain Tumour Research Centre of Excellence this week at Queen Mary’s Hospital in London 🏥

🗣️ “Until I met Shay’s parents, Niki and Deenu, I wasn’t aware how tough the outlook was for brain tumour patients. It was shocking to discover that one in three children who die of cancer is killed by a brain tumour.”

A beautiful gesture from Chilwell 👏❤️

🗣️ “I just felt like I was missing something and that was just being able to get involved in the game as much as I could and in the NFL is obviously very different to that.”

“I got no regrets coming back. I think it was more if I never went… that was going to be the regret. I had an unbelievable 18 months over there, it was such a good journey. I learnt so much about myself. I got to learn so much from the likes of Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Chris Jones and then at the Jacksonville Jaguars. You just kind of see how they work every day on and off the field and hopefully I can bring that to rugby.”

The 24-year-old Welshman will be eager to hit the ground running when the rugby season starts next month 🫡

“When Liverpool had it they got Klopp, they stuck with him, they didn’t win in the beginning, people only remember his final few years.”

🗣️ “Is it great to be able to win tournaments and to accomplish the things I have in the game of golf? Yeah I mean it brings a tears to my eyes just thinking about it because it’s what I literally worked my whole life to become good at the sport and that sense of accomplishment, I think it’s a pretty cool feeling... but at the end of the day I’m not here to inspire the next generation of golfers. I don’t.

“I’m not here to inspire somebody else to be the best player in the world, because what’s the point? You know, this is not a fulfilling life. It’s fulfilling from the sense of the accomplishment, but it’s not fulfilling from a sense of like, the deepest places of your heart... You’re like, why do I want to win this tournament so bad? That’s something that I wrestle with on a daily basis.

“It’s like showing up at the Masters every year. Why do I want to win this golf tournament so badly? Why do I want to win The Open Championship so badly? I don’t know, because if I win, it’s going to be awesome for two minutes.”

Nothing but honesty from Scheffler 👏","https://scontent-mia5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/520339153_18529944034055282_9026728007374762451_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080_sh0.08_tt6&_nc_ht=scontent-mia5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QH1RwGDZnKBEh72r0DgZ5GsdSObGqabnaU4viiCutPM9IEDz-Xu-wDYJsTw_YcYFfc&_nc_ohc=LEsHwAvtJpoQ7kNvwH-Nlti&_nc_gid=83lIZxIFlPOyg57u5apFHQ&edm=APs17CUBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfbGJyX2sLYkvURJ7qUwa3z9guToDqxSG7a2g8y5vsEy2w&oe=68C7781C&_nc_sid=10d13b","3677402946384052323",,"SPORTbible","812791281","sportbible","DMIwn77MkBj","2025-07-15T17:30:00.000Z","Image",,,,,,"https://www.instagram.com/p/DMIwn77MkBj/","https://www.instagram.com/sportbible/"

🗣️ “That’s the toughest thing when you’re losing matches... To start losing, it’s scary at the end of the day... It’s not an easy thing in sport to not be good enough.

“I don’t know why I’m so emotional about it. I’ve spoken that much about it with other people. I guess I’m pretty proud of the last four or five months and how they’ve been. They’ve been difficult and I’m happy to have come through the other side.

“But the last few weeks have been good to see I’ve still got it because it’s easy to say you believe it but it’s got to happen otherwise you drop down the rankings.”

Nothing but honesty from Evans 💪👏

🗣️ “She’s going to be the boss! I've known Emma since a really long time ago, so we know each other. I have a really good relationship with her. So it's just going to be interesting.

“'I was thinking that I couldn't play better if it wasn't with Emma. I just asked Emma if she wants to play doubles with me. Yeah, I made that special request.

“She took a while haha! No, not that much, not that much. But obviously she had to ask, and she had to think a little bit. But it wasn't a minute, so…”

Both will be hoping to add a doubles title to their US Open singles titles 🇺🇸🏆

🗣️ “I know it’s been like it for a very long time and we have to accept it, but off air I was talking to Jamie Carragher and said ‘how can you score three goals away from home and not have an advantage?’. 

“Away goals, for me, were massive because you scored three goals away and you still don’t have an advantage of having a 0-0 at home?”

Do you prefer the away goals rule? 🤔

But I decided to board anyways because I figured if they checked tickets they would just turn me around and there would be no harm done.”

“⁠I had a blast on the boat and at the Southend game. I had so much fun that I plan to go to another Southend game next weekend and hopefully they can pull out the win. ⁠I’m a Southend fan till I die now.”

The Brazilian revealed he signed the new deal in January as he couldn’t leave the club in a ‘difficult’ situation with them in a relegation battle 🐺

🗣️“I had a lot of offers in January, but I wouldn’t feel well if I had done it. Some things you can’t control but I couldn’t leave the club in the middle of the season, in a difficult situation, in the relegation zone.

“Now, we’re close to achieving our goal of staying up. But I’ve made it clear that I need to take the next step. I want to fight for titles, for big things. I have potential.”

Nothing but honesty from Cunha, but should Wolves fans be annoyed with him? 🤔

“He touched on things that nobody else got. No matter how many times I tried to express myself, I couldn’t. Nobody could relate to what I was going through. He is now a good friend of mine. He came to watch me train the other day in Barcelona. So, there are positives to come out of it - the new relationships I’ve formed.”

🗣 “We had a robust discussion. We told each other some truths, but then I didn’t play for almost two months. I said I didn’t agree with certain ways of doing things regarding the relationship between him and the team.

“It wasn’t something that I thought was good for the team because some of the players weren’t at all satisfied. It was not good in terms of the relationship with the coach. He said ‘OK, I hear what you said’ and after that I didn’t play.”

Erik Ten Hag certainly took no prisoners during his time as manager 😳

🗣️ Casemiro: “I have to keep doing what I’m doing, with a lot of respect and good behaviour. Of course, I’d like to play more. I don’t know any player who doesn’t want to play and help. I’d like to help the club at this time. I face things with respect for my teammates & staff and above all, respect for United.”
